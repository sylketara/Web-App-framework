WEB APP FRAMEWORK
=========================

This is a basic skeleton of a web application.

The purpose is to be the starting point for your very own web app. In this particular case we are using "Express".

At the moment there are no databases attached to this template however should you wish to build on this for your own app the suggested database to use is a **MongoDB** database, and use **Mongoose** to access the DB.

There are no API's attached in this template.

The app doesn't understand the concept of users, authentication or authorisation.

Installation
-----------
The application should then be available on **localhost** on port 3002.
